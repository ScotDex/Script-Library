.SYNOPSIS
    This script creates firewall rules for Portainer ports and logs the actions.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script defines a set of ports required for Portainer communication and UI access.
    It creates inbound firewall rules for these ports, logs the actions to a specified log file,
    and validates the creation of the firewall rules.

.PARAMETER ports
    An array of hashtables defining the ports, protocols, and names for the firewall rules.

.PARAMETER logFilePath
    The path to the log file where the firewall rule creation details will be recorded.
