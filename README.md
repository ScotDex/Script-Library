# Linux System Maintenance Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to address the common issue of system clutter and disk space errors on Linux systems. These scripts aim to simplify the management of disk space and reduce the headache of encountering "disk error: no space left" messages.

As a systems engineer who is continually learning, these scripts are fundamental in nature and will evolve and improve over time. Your suggestions and contributions to enhance these scripts are highly encouraged and welcomed.

## Features:

- **Systemclean:** This script is intended to clean up system clutter and reclaim disk space by removing unnecessary files and optimizing system resources.
- **Logclean:** Designed to manage log files efficiently, this script helps in clearing out old and redundant log files, keeping the system logs organized and the disk space usage in check.
- **Upgrade:** This script automates the process of upgrading system components and packages, ensuring that your system stays up-to-date with the latest security patches and enhancements.

## Usage:

1. Make sure to set the file permissions as executable by running the following command:

- sudo chmod +x filename

Replace "filename" with the name of the script you intend to use.

2. Execute the desired script using the following commands:

./systemclean
./logclean
./upgrade


**Note:** 
- The scripts include debug functionality, providing commentary on the actions being performed for your peace of mind and transparency in system maintenance operations.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this repository to make Linux system maintenance smoother and more efficient.

Cheers, Dex
