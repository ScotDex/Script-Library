Hello

A common issue with linux is that your system gets cluttered, this collection of scripts are design to reduce the headache of "disk error nae space left"

They are pretty basic, as I am a systems engineer I am just learning so they will develop and improve over time - suggestions are welcome.

I have also added debug to both scripts which provides commentary on whats going on, just as peace of mind :)

Remember to set the file as executable by entering sudo chmod +x *filename*

Script commands to start then.

  ```./systemclean```
  ```./logclean```
  ```./upgrade```

Cheers 

Dex
